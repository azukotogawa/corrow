some cabin shit; purgatory, crossfaded
planet earth. transcribed



Why is your arm inside your body

Why is everything a different color

The ocean is green

Randomly stands up "taco" then "leaking"
Ssw wa wasswsswsswa 
I can feel sound

The burrito is expanding out of my mouth

Why is there a campfire in here?

Shadowclown kungfoo

Would you just gag me
*chokes on water

I can see through my hand

Says dynamic wrong 15 times

Watch my head

Says taco again

Are you a bird

Why do u have a beak on your face I can see it

You have a beak on your face and your Arms are wings

That scared the shit out of me I saw a dinosaur

Where are the Aliens taking us

Why is the room a cube

Oh my god I am inside a cube

How big is it?

How big is the giant baseball

Is the burrito still in my mouth?

How many body parts do I have?
*Brielle points to 15 of them

Cole "there are only 2" the Top half and the bottom half

Brielle "which direction is earth spinning?"

"My mouth taste orange, theres a purple and theres a green"

"Theres a skeleton inside you"

"How long is my leg?"

"Wheres my head go"

WHICH WAYS LEFT
